git-shortlog \- Summarize \*(Aqgit log\*(Aq output
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
.nf
\fIgit shortlog\fR [<options>] [<revision range>] [[\-\-] <path>\&...]
git log \-\-pretty=short | \fIgit shortlog\fR [<options>]
.fi
.sp
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Summarizes \fIgit log\fR output in a format suitable for inclusion in release announcements\&. Each commit will be grouped by author and title\&.
.sp
Additionally, "[PATCH]" will be stripped from the commit description\&.
.sp
If no revisions are passed on the command line and either standard input is not a terminal or there is no current branch, \fIgit shortlog\fR will output a summary of the log read from standard input, without reference to the current repository\&.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.PP
\-n, \-\-numbered
.RS 4
Sort output according to the number of commits per author instead of author alphabetic order\&.
.RE
.PP
\-s, \-\-summary
.RS 4
Suppress commit description and provide a commit count summary only\&.
.RE
.PP
\-e, \-\-email
.RS 4
Show the email address of each author\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-format[=<format>]
.RS 4
Instead of the commit subject, use some other information to describe each commit\&.
\fI<format>\fR
can be any string accepted by the
\fB\-\-format\fR
option of
\fIgit log\fR, such as
\fI* [%h] %s\fR\&. (See the "PRETTY FORMATS" section of
\fBgit-log\fR(1)\&.)
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Each pretty\-printed commit will be rewrapped before it is shown\&.
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.RE
.PP
\-c, \-\-committer
.RS 4
Collect and show committer identities instead of authors\&.
.RE
.PP
\-w[<width>[,<indent1>[,<indent2>]]]
.RS 4
Linewrap the output by wrapping each line at
\fBwidth\fR\&. The first line of each entry is indented by
\fBindent1\fR
spaces, and the second and subsequent lines are indented by
\fBindent2\fR
spaces\&.
\fBwidth\fR,
\fBindent1\fR, and
\fBindent2\fR
default to 76, 6 and 9 respectively\&.
.sp
If width is
\fB0\fR
(zero) then indent the lines of the output without wrapping them\&.
.RE
.PP
<revision range>
.RS 4
Show only commits in the specified revision range\&. When no <revision range> is specified, it defaults to
\fBHEAD\fR
(i\&.e\&. the whole history leading to the current commit)\&.
\fBorigin\&.\&.HEAD\fR
specifies all the commits reachable from the current commit (i\&.e\&.
\fBHEAD\fR), but not from
\fBorigin\fR\&. For a complete list of ways to spell <revision range>, see the "Specifying Ranges" section of
\fBgitrevisions\fR(7)\&.
.RE
.PP
[\-\-] <path>\&...
.RS 4
Consider only commits that are enough to explain how the files that match the specified paths came to be\&.
.sp
Paths may need to be prefixed with
\fB\-\-\fR
to separate them from options or the revision range, when confusion arises\&.
.RE
.SS "Commit Limiting"
.sp
Besides specifying a range of commits that should be listed using the special notations explained in the description, additional commit limiting may be applied\&.
.sp
Using more options generally further limits the output (e\&.g\&. \fB\-\-since=<date1>\fR limits to commits newer than \fB<date1>\fR, and using it with \fB\-\-grep=<pattern>\fR further limits to commits whose log message has a line that matches \fB<pattern>\fR), unless otherwise noted\&.
.sp
Note that these are applied before commit ordering and formatting options, such as \fB\-\-reverse\fR\&.
.PP
\-<number>, \-n <number>, \-\-max\-count=<number>
.RS 4
Limit the number of commits to output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-skip=<number>
.RS 4
Skip
\fInumber\fR
commits before starting to show the commit output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-since=<date>, \-\-after=<date>
.RS 4
Show commits more recent than a specific date\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-until=<date>, \-\-before=<date>
.RS 4
Show commits older than a specific date\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-author=<pattern>, \-\-committer=<pattern>
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to ones with author/committer header lines that match the specified pattern (regular expression)\&. With more than one
\fB\-\-author=<pattern>\fR, commits whose author matches any of the given patterns are chosen (similarly for multiple
\fB\-\-committer=<pattern>\fR)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-grep\-reflog=<pattern>
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to ones with reflog entries that match the specified pattern (regular expression)\&. With more than one
\fB\-\-grep\-reflog\fR, commits whose reflog message matches any of the given patterns are chosen\&. It is an error to use this option unless
\fB\-\-walk\-reflogs\fR
is in use\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-grep=<pattern>
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to ones with log message that matches the specified pattern (regular expression)\&. With more than one
\fB\-\-grep=<pattern>\fR, commits whose message matches any of the given patterns are chosen (but see
\fB\-\-all\-match\fR)\&.
.sp
When
\fB\-\-notes\fR
is in effect, the message from the notes is matched as if it were part of the log message\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-all\-match
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to ones that match all given
\fB\-\-grep\fR, instead of ones that match at least one\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-invert\-grep
.RS 4
Limit the commits output to ones with log message that do not match the pattern specified with
\fB\-\-grep=<pattern>\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-i, \-\-regexp\-ignore\-case
.RS 4
Match the regular expression limiting patterns without regard to letter case\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-basic\-regexp
.RS 4
Consider the limiting patterns to be basic regular expressions; this is the default\&.
.RE
.PP
\-E, \-\-extended\-regexp
.RS 4
Consider the limiting patterns to be extended regular expressions instead of the default basic regular expressions\&.
.RE
.PP
\-F, \-\-fixed\-strings
.RS 4
Consider the limiting patterns to be fixed strings (don\(cqt interpret pattern as a regular expression)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-P, \-\-perl\-regexp
.RS 4
Consider the limiting patterns to be Perl\-compatible regular expressions\&.
.sp
Support for these types of regular expressions is an optional compile\-time dependency\&. If Git wasn\(cqt compiled with support for them providing this option will cause it to die\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-remove\-empty
.RS 4
Stop when a given path disappears from the tree\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-merges
.RS 4
Print only merge commits\&. This is exactly the same as
\fB\-\-min\-parents=2\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-no\-merges
.RS 4
Do not print commits with more than one parent\&. This is exactly the same as
\fB\-\-max\-parents=1\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-min\-parents=<number>, \-\-max\-parents=<number>, \-\-no\-min\-parents, \-\-no\-max\-parents
.RS 4
Show only commits which have at least (or at most) that many parent commits\&. In particular,
\fB\-\-max\-parents=1\fR
is the same as
\fB\-\-no\-merges\fR,
\fB\-\-min\-parents=2\fR
is the same as
\fB\-\-merges\fR\&.
\fB\-\-max\-parents=0\fR
gives all root commits and
\fB\-\-min\-parents=3\fR
all octopus merges\&.
.sp
\fB\-\-no\-min\-parents\fR
and
\fB\-\-no\-max\-parents\fR
reset these limits (to no limit) again\&. Equivalent forms are
\fB\-\-min\-parents=0\fR
(any commit has 0 or more parents) and
\fB\-\-max\-parents=\-1\fR
(negative numbers denote no upper limit)\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-first\-parent
.RS 4
Follow only the first parent commit upon seeing a merge commit\&. This option can give a better overview when viewing the evolution of a particular topic branch, because merges into a topic branch tend to be only about adjusting to updated upstream from time to time, and this option allows you to ignore the individual commits brought in to your history by such a merge\&. Cannot be combined with \-\-bisect\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-not
.RS 4
Reverses the meaning of the
\fI^\fR

.RE
.PP
\-\-tags[=<pattern>]
.RS 4
Pretend as if all the refs in
\fBrefs/tags\fR
are listed on the command line as
\fI<commit>\fR\&. If

\-\-remotes[=<pattern>]
.RS 4
Pretend as if all the refs in
\fBrefs/remotes\fR
are listed on the command line as
\fI<commit>\fR\&. If
\fI<pattern>\fR
is given, limit remote\-tracking branches to ones matching given shell glob\&. If pattern lacks
\fI?\fR,
\fI*\fR, or
\fI[\fR,
\fI/*\fR
at the end is implied\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-glob=<glob\-pattern>
.RS 4
Pretend as if all the refs matching shell glob
\fI<glob\-pattern>\fR
are listed on the command line as
\fI<commit>\fR\&. Leading
\fIrefs/\fR, is automatically prepended if missing\&. If pattern lacks
\fI?\fR,
\fI*\fR, or

\fI/*\fR
at the end is implied\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-exclude=<glob\-pattern>
.RS 4
Do not include refs matching
\fI<glob\-pattern>\fR
that the next
\fB\-\-all\fR,
\fB\-\-branches\fR,
\fB\-\-tags\fR,
\fB\-\-remotes\fR, or
\fB\-\-glob\fR
would otherwise consider\&. Repetitions of this option accumulate exclusion patterns up to the next
\fB\-\-all\fR,
\fB\-\-branches\fR,
\fB\-\-tags\fR,
\fB\-\-remotes\fR, or
\fB\-\-glob\fR
option (other options or arguments do not clear accumulated patterns)\&.
.sp
The patterns given should not begin with
\fBrefs/heads\fR,
\fBrefs/tags\fR, or
\fBrefs/remotes\fR
when applied to
\fB\-\-branches\fR,
\fB\-\-tags\fR, or
\fB\-\-remotes\fR, respectively, and they must begin with
\fBrefs/\fR

.RE
.PP
\-\-alternate\-refs

\fBrefs/bisect/bad\fR
was listed and as if it was followed by

.RE
.PP
\-\-cherry\-mark
.RS 4
Like
\fB\-\-cherry\-pick\fR
(see below) but mark equivalent commits with
\fB=\fR
rather than omitting them, and inequivalent ones with
\fB+\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cherry\-pick
.RS 4
Omit any commit that introduces the same change as another commit on the \(lqother side\(rq when the set of commits are limited with symmetric difference\&.
.sp
For example, if you have two branches,
\fBA\fR
and
\fBB\fR, a usual way to list all commits on only one side of them is with
\fB\-\-left\-right\fR
(see the example below in the description of the
\fB\-\-left\-right\fR
option)\&. However, it shows the commits that were cherry\-picked from the other branch (for example, \(lq3rd on b\(rq may be cherry\-picked from branch A)\&. With this option, such pairs of commits are excluded from the output\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-left\-only, \-\-right\-only
.RS 4
List only commits on the respective side of a symmetric difference, i\&.e\&. only those which would be marked
\fB<\fR
resp\&.
\fB>\fR
by
\fB\-\-left\-right\fR\&.
.sp
For example,
\fB\-\-cherry\-pick \-\-right\-only A\&.\&.\&.B\fR
omits those commits from
\fBB\fR
which are in
\fBA\fR
or are patch\-equivalent to a commit in
\fBA\fR\&. In other words, this lists the
\fB+\fR
commits from
\fBgit cherry A B\fR\&. More precisely,
\fB\-\-cherry\-pick \-\-right\-only \-\-no\-merges\fR
gives the exact list\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-cherry
.RS 4
A synonym for
\fB\-\-right\-only \-\-cherry\-mark \-\-no\-merges\fR; useful to limit the output to the commits on our side and mark those that have been applied to the other side of a forked history with
\fBgit log \-\-cherry upstream\&.\&.\&.mybranch\fR, similar to
\fBgit cherry upstream mybranch\fR\&.
.RE
.PP
\-g, \-\-walk\-reflogs
.RS 4
Instead of walking the commit ancestry chain, walk reflog entries from the most recent one to older ones\&. When this option is used you cannot specify commits to exclude (that is,
\fI^commit\fR,
\fIcommit1\&.\&.commit2\fR, and
\fIcommit1\&.\&.\&.commit2\fR
notations cannot be used)\&.
.sp
With
\fB\-\-pretty\fR
format other than
\fBoneline\fR
and
\fBreference\fR
(for obvious reasons), this causes the output to have two extra lines of information taken from the reflog\&. The reflog designator in the output may be shown as
\fBref@{Nth}\fR
(where
\fBNth\fR
is the reverse\-chronological index in the reflog) or as
\fBref@{timestamp}\fR
(with the timestamp for that entry), depending on a few rules:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.sp -1
.IP "  1." 4.2

.RS 4
.ie n \{\

.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 3.\h'+01'\c

.RE
.sp
Under
\fB\-\-pretty=oneline\fR, the commit message is prefixed with this information on the same line\&. This option cannot be combined with
\fB\-\-reverse\fR\&. See also
\fBgit-reflog\fR(1)\&.
.sp

.RE
.SS "History Simplification"
.sp
Sometimes you are only interested in parts of the history, for example the commits modifying a particular <path>\&. But there are two parts of \fIHistory Simplification\fR, one part is selecting the commits and the other is how to do it, as there are various strategies to simplify the history\&.
.sp
The following options select the commits to be shown:
.PP
<paths>
.RS 4
Commits modifying the given <paths> are selected\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-simplify\-by\-decoration
.RS 4
Commits that are referred by some branch or tag are selected\&.
.RE
.sp
Note that extra commits can be shown to give a meaningful history\&.
.sp
The following options affect the way the simplification is performed:
.PP
Default mode
.RS 4
Simplifies the history to the simplest history explaining the final state of the tree\&. Simplest because it prunes some side branches if the end result is the same (i\&.e\&. merging branches with the same content)
.RE
.PP
\-\-full\-history
.RS 4
Same as the default mode, but does not prune some history\&.
.RE

A more detailed explanation follows\&.
.sp
Suppose you specified \fBfoo\fR as the <paths>\&. We shall call commits that modify \fBfoo\fR !TREESAME, and the rest TREESAME\&. (In a diff filtered for \fBfoo\fR, they look different and equal, respectively\&.)

In the following, we will always refer to the same example history to illustrate the differences between simplification settings\&. We assume that you are filtering for a file \fBfoo\fR in this commit graph:

This mode differs from the default in one point: always follow all parents of a merge, even if it is TREESAME to one of them\&. Even if more than one side of the merge has commits that are included, this does not imply that the merge itself is! In the example, we get
.sp
.if n \{\

\fBM\fR

\fBE\fR,

were all walked, but only
\fBB\fR
was !TREESAME, so the others do not appear\&.

Note that without parent rewriting, it is not really possible to talk about the parent/child relationships between the commits, so we show them disconnected\&.

Ordinary commits are only included if they are !TREESAME (though this can be changed, see

Merges are always included\&. However, their parent list is rewritten: Along each parent, prune away commits that are not included themselves\&. This results in

Compare to
\fB\-\-full\-history\fR
without rewriting above\&. Note that
\fBE\fR
was pruned away because it is TREESAME, but the parent list of P was rewritten to contain

\fBI\fR\&. The same happened for
\fBC\fR

\fBN\fR, and
\fBX\fR,
\fBY\fR

In addition to the above settings, you can change whether TREESAME affects inclusion:
.PP
\-\-dense
.RS 4
Commits that are walked are included if they are not TREESAME to any parent\&.
.RE
.PP
\-\-sparse
.RS 4
All commits that are walked are included\&.

Note that without
\fB\-\-full\-history\fR, this still simplifies merges: if one of the parents is TREESAME, we follow only that one, so the other sides of the merge are never walked\&.

First, build a history graph in the same way that

Then simplify each commit

in the final history according to the following rules:
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\

.el \{\

Replace each parent
\fBP\fR
of
\fBC\*(Aq\fR

\fBP\*(Aq\fR\&. In the process, drop parents that are ancestors of other parents or that are root commits TREESAME to an empty tree, and remove duplicates, but take care to never drop all parents that we are TREESAME to\&.

If after this parent rewriting,
\fBC\*(Aq\fR
is a root or merge commit (has zero or >1 parents), a boundary commit, or !TREESAME, it remains\&. Otherwise, it is replaced with its only parent\&.
.RE

The effect of this is best shown by way of comparing to
\fB\-\-full\-history\fR
with parent rewriting\&. The example turns into:

Note the major differences in

\fBN\fR\*(Aqs parent list had

Finally, there is a fifth simplification mode available:
.PP
\-\-ancestry\-path
.RS 4
Limit the displayed commits to those directly on the ancestry chain between the \(lqfrom\(rq and \(lqto\(rq commits in the given commit range\&. I\&.e\&. only display commits that are ancestor of the \(lqto\(rq commit and descendants of the \(lqfrom\(rq commit\&.
.sp
As an example use case, consider the following commit history:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
            D\-\-\-E\-\-\-\-\-\-\-F

A regular
\fID\&.\&.M\fR
computes the set of commits that are ancestors of
\fBM\fR, but excludes the ones that are ancestors of
\fBD\fR\&. This is useful to see what happened to the history leading to
\fBM\fR
since
\fBD\fR, in the sense that \(lqwhat does
\fBM\fR
have that did not exist in
\fBD\fR\(rq\&. The result in this example would be all the commits, except
\fBA\fR
and
\fBB\fR
(and
\fBD\fR
itself, of course)\&.
.sp
When we want to find out what commits in
\fBM\fR
are contaminated with the bug introduced by
\fBD\fR
and need fixing, however, we might want to view only the subset of
\fID\&.\&.M\fR
that are actually descendants of
\fBD\fR, i\&.e\&. excluding
\fBC\fR
and
\fBK\fR\&. This is exactly what the
\fB\-\-ancestry\-path\fR
option does\&. Applied to the
\fID\&.\&.M\fR
range, it results in:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
                E\-\-\-\-\-\-\-F
                 \e       \e

The \fB\-\-simplify\-by\-decoration\fR option allows you to view only the big picture of the topology of the history, by omitting commits that are not referenced by tags\&. Commits are marked as !TREESAME (in other words, kept after history simplification rules described above) if (1) they are referenced by tags, or (2) they change the contents of the paths given on the command line\&. All other commits are marked as TREESAME (subject to be simplified away)\&.
.SH "MAPPING AUTHORS"
.sp
The \fB\&.mailmap\fR feature is used to coalesce together commits by the same person in the shortlog, where their name and/or email address was spelled differently\&.
.sp
If the file \fB\&.mailmap\fR exists at the toplevel of the repository, or at the location pointed to by the mailmap\&.file or mailmap\&.blob configuration options, it is used to map author and committer names and email addresses to canonical real names and email addresses\&.
.sp
In the simple form, each line in the file consists of the canonical real name of an author, whitespace, and an email address used in the commit (enclosed by \fI<\fR and \fI>\fR) to map to the name\&. For example:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Proper Name <commit@email\&.xx>
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
The more complex forms are:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
<proper@email\&.xx> <commit@email\&.xx>
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
which allows mailmap to replace only the email part of a commit, and:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Proper Name <proper@email\&.xx> <commit@email\&.xx>
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
which allows mailmap to replace both the name and the email of a commit matching the specified commit email address, and:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Proper Name <proper@email\&.xx> Commit Name <commit@email\&.xx>
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
which allows mailmap to replace both the name and the email of a commit matching both the specified commit name and email address\&.
.sp
Example 1: Your history contains commits by two authors, Jane and Joe, whose names appear in the repository under several forms:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Joe Developer <joe@example\&.com>
Joe R\&. Developer <joe@example\&.com>
Jane Doe <jane@example\&.com>
Jane Doe <jane@laptop\&.(none)>
Jane D\&. <jane@desktop\&.(none)>
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
Now suppose that Joe wants his middle name initial used, and Jane prefers her family name fully spelled out\&. A proper \fB\&.mailmap\fR file would look like:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
Jane Doe         <jane@desktop\&.(none)>
Joe R\&. Developer <joe@example\&.com>
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
Note how there is no need for an entry for \fB<jane@laptop\&.(none)>\fR, because the real name of that author is already correct\&.
.sp
Example 2: Your repository contains commits from the following authors:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
nick1 <bugs@company\&.xx>
nick2 <bugs@company\&.xx>
nick2 <nick2@company\&.xx>
santa <me@company\&.xx>
claus <me@company\&.xx>
CTO <cto@coompany\&.xx>
.fi
.if n \{\
.RE
.\}
.sp
.sp
Then you might want a \fB\&.mailmap\fR file that looks like:
.sp
.if n \{\
.RS 4
.\}
.nf
<cto@company\&.xx>                       <cto@coompany\&.xx>
Some Dude <some@dude\&.xx>         nick1 <bugs@company\&.xx>
Other Author <other@author\&.xx>   nick2 <bugs@company\&.xx>
Other Author <other@author\&.xx>         <nick2@company\&.xx>
Santa Claus <santa\&.claus@northpole\&.xx> <me@company\&.xx>

.if n \{\
